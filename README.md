Welcome, I'm Benjamin Willey, a junior Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M focusing on computer systems and architecture. 

This website is mainly for fun, but also, it's for learning and experimenting.


 This website will be replaced by a new one that Im developing in my software engineering class. I started 1/24, and it should be done mid February.
